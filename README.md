## Overview
Efficient evacuation strategies during natural disasters are critical for minimizing casualties and mitigating property damage. Disasters like earthquakes, hurricanes, and wildfires necessitate swift and well-coordinated evacuation protocols. Determining the most optimal evacuation route is a multifaceted challenge influenced by variables such as road conditions, traffic flow, and population density.

Traditionally, heuristic algorithms have been employed for route optimization. However, their reliance on predetermined rules often proves inadequate in dynamic disaster scenarios, where conditions rapidly evolve. In contrast, non-heuristic approaches offer a more adaptive solution by considering all potential routes and factors impacting evacuation efficiency.

This project introduces a visualizer platform that evaluates and compares various non-heuristic algorithms post-natural disasters. The primary goal is to assess the performance of different algorithms across diverse scenarios and identify the most effective approach for evacuation planning.

## Features
- Simulates a range of disaster scenarios with varying obstacles to test algorithmic adaptability and efficiency.
- Implements and compares algorithms such as Dijkstra, A*, BFS, and DFS.
- Provides graphical representations of algorithmic results for better decision-making during crises.
- Serves as an educational tool for stakeholders interested in evacuation planning.
